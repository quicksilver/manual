# Appendix

This appendix contains additional reference material and resources for working with Quicksilver.

## Reference Documents

In 2006 and 2007 Howard Melman wrote a comprehensive manual for Quicksilver. Much of it is still useful for explaining what Quicksilver does and how to use it, though some configuration details have changed.

  * [Quicksilver Quick Reference (PDF)](http://qsapp.com/docs/QSRef.pdf) — Lists all actions in all supported plugins, proxy objects, and most shortcuts. Updated for Quicksilver 1.0.
