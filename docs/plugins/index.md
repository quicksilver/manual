# Plugins

Quicksilver is designed with a modular architecture. While the core application provides basic functionality, most of Quicksilver's powerful features are implemented through plugins. This design allows you to customize Quicksilver by installing only the plugins you need.

## Installing and Managing Plugins

Plugins are managed entirely from within Quicksilver's Plugins Preference pane. You can find, install, enable, disable, and remove plugins without ever leaving Quicksilver.

For detailed instructions on how to install and manage plugins, see the [Plugins Preferences](../preferences/plugins.md) section.

## Available Plugins

This section contains documentation for all available Quicksilver plugins. Each plugin page describes:

- What the plugin does
- What features and actions it provides
- Any special configuration needed
- Tips for getting the most out of the plugin

Browse through the plugin list in the sidebar to discover what's available. During initial setup, Quicksilver recommends plugins based on the applications you have installed, but there are many more specialized plugins you might find useful.

## See Also

Many of the features described in the [Features](../features/index.md) section require specific plugins to be installed. The feature documentation will note which plugins are needed for each capability.
