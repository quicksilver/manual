### Twitter Plugin

Enables posting of tweets, messages and direct messages to Twitter from within
Quicksilver

#### Setup

**Twitter Login**

In order to post tweets from Quicksilver, you must authenticate Quicksilver
with your Twitter account. Do this by going to the [Twitter plugin
preferences](qs://preferences#QSTwitterPrefPane) and clicking the 'Sign In'
button. Your Twitter login details are stored securely in OS X's Keychain.app
for access across computer and app relaunches. You can remove the login
details at any time by clicking the 'Sign Out' button in the Twitter
preference pane.

**Twitter Contacts**

Some actions require a contact to send a direct message/message to. These
actions accept both text (e.g. in the form '@Twitter') or a contact from your
Address Book (requires the Contacts plugin). In order to use contacts
directly, you must ensure that your contacts have their Twitter username field
set in Address Book.app / Contacts.app

#### Actions

**Send Tweet**

The 'Tweet' action takes text in Quicksilver's 1st pane and posts a tweet
directly to Twitter

**Send Tweet… / Send Tweet To…**

Use the 'Tweet…' action to send a contact selected in Quicksilver's 1st pane
(either a contact from your Contacts list or a username entered as text) the
text entered in Quicksilver's 3rd pane. The 'Send Tweet To…' action works in
reverse, taking text in Quicksilver's 1st pane and a contact in Quicksilver's
3rd pane.

**Send Direct Message… / Send Direct Message To…**

'Send Direct Message…' can be used to send a contact (selected in
Quicksilver's 1st pane) a direct message entered as text in Quicksilver's 3rd
pane. The 'Send Direct Message To…' action works in reverse.
