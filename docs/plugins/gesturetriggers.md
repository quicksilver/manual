# Abracadabra Triggers

This plug-in allows you to trigger actions in Quicksilver by drawing a gesture
on screen using a mouse or trackpad.

Gestures are initiated by holding either a modifier key (Shift, Control, etc.)
or a mouse button.

Colors and sounds are customizable in the preferences under Abracadabra.

## Creating a Trigger

  1. In the Triggers… preferences, add a new trigger using the `+` button and choose "Gesture".
  2. Click somewhere in the info panel's box and hold the button down.
  3. Draw the desired gesture, then release the button.
  4. Optionally, define the applications where the trigger should be active under the Scope tab.

### Tips

  * It helps to practice the gesture a few times before setting it.
  * You can replace an existing gesture at any time by simply drawing a new one.
  * When defining a gesture, only the initial click needs to be inside the box. You can go outside of it when drawing, so draw the gesture at the size that feels natural for real-world use.
