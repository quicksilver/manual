### DeMinimizer Plugin

Adds actions and triggers to minimize and restore windows

#### Setup

  * Ensure 'Enable access for assistive devices' is enabled in the Universal Access preference pane
  * Customize the provided triggers appropriately

#### Usage

Try the bundled triggers -- three of them are for restoring minimized windows
and one of them should minimize all windows.  

There is also a 'Minimized Windows' proxy object which can be used to observe
a list of minimized windows. The proxy object and individual minimized windows
which it resolves to may also be used with the 'Restore Minimized Window'
action.
