# Triggers

Triggers allow you to execute Quicksilver commands without having to use the command window. Quicksilver supports executing triggers based on

  * [Keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-triggers.md) (built-in)
  * [Mouse position and/or buttons](mouse-triggers.md) (Mouse Triggers plugin)
  * [System Events](event-triggers.md) (Event Triggers plugin)
  * [Gestures](gestures.md) (Abracadabra Triggers plugin)

Triggers are available whenever Quicksilver is running and you do not have to invoke Quicksilver to use them. Triggers make it easier to control iTunes, launch applications, perform web searches, or do anything else Quicksilver can do. You can create as many as you want but you probably want them only for the operations you do frequently.

## Setting Up Triggers

To learn how to create and configure triggers in the Triggers Preference pane, see the [Triggers Preferences](../../preferences/triggers.md) section.

## Trigger Types

Each type of trigger has different strengths and use cases:

- **[Keyboard Triggers](keyboard-triggers.md)** - The most common type, activated by keyboard shortcuts
- **[Mouse Triggers](mouse-triggers.md)** - Activated by mouse clicks, positions, or dragging files to screen edges/corners
- **[Event Triggers](event-triggers.md)** - Automatically run in response to system events like waking from sleep or network changes
- **[Gesture Triggers](gestures.md)** - Draw shapes with your mouse to activate commands

For examples of useful triggers, see the [Example Triggers](examples.md) section.
