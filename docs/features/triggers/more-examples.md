# More Trigger Ideas

The possibilities for triggers seem endless. Here are some triggers people have posted on the Quicksilver forums as their favorites:

  * Documents ⇥ **Open**
  * Finder Selection ⇥ **Go To Directory in Terminal**
  * Finder Selection ⇥ **Rename…**
  * Finder Selection ⇥ **Scale Image…** ⇥ 400 
  * Finder Selection ⇥ **Open With…** ⇥ TextMate
  * Current Application ⇥ **Menu Bar…**
  * Current Application ⇥ **Menu Bar Items…**
  * Current Application ⇥ **Show Menu Items**
  * Current Application ⇥ **Relaunch**
  * Current Application ⇥ **Hide Others** (though <kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>H</kbd> already works in most every application)
  * Previous Application ⇥ **Open** (go back to what you were doing last, toggle between two apps, or restore focus if Quicksilver steals it)
  * Artist Now Playing ⇥ **Show Contents**
  * Browse Albums ⇥ **Search Contents**
  * killall Dock ⇥ **Run Command in Shell** (or any other frequent shell command)
  * `pbpaste | pbcopy` ⇥ **Run Command in Shell** (re-copies the clipboard contents without formatting)
  * `date` ⇥ **Run Command in Shell** (acts like a clock)
  * Current Web Page ⇥ **Open With…** ⇥ [Some Web Browser]
  * Removable Disks ⇥ **Eject** (great to clean up mounted disk images)
  * Network Disks ⇥ **Eject**

There are some limits to triggers that you can create. You can’t save a trigger for something that isn’t in your catalog. So the Current Application ⇥ **Menu Bar…** trigger above works, but you can’t do Current Application ⇥ **Menu Bar…** ⇥ Help because the “Help” item is created on demand. Also, actions that appear only for particular applications can’t be saved as triggers, so you can’t do Mail (**Get New Mail**). For most of these, you can physically create the trigger, but the objects involved will disappear when Quicksilver restarts, making it impossible to set up the trigger again.
