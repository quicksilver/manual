# Alternate Actions

Alternate actions are a powerful feature of Quicksilver. When a user selects an action in the second pane, they can hit <kbd>↩</kbd> to run it, or they can hit <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>↩</kbd> to run an alternate (if one is defined). Generally an alternate action will be similar to the main action, but modified in some way.

You can view the alternate to a given action (if it exists) by holding the <kbd>⌘</kbd> key when Quicksilver's interface is open. You can view a full list of the alternate actions in the "Alternate Action (<kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>↩</kbd>)" column of the Actions preference pane.
