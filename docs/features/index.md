# Features

Quicksilver comes with many powerful features built right in. This section covers the core functionality available out of the box, organized by the types of objects and tasks Quicksilver can work with.

From managing files and folders, to controlling applications, working with contacts and mail, browsing the web, manipulating text, and much more—Quicksilver provides a unified interface for interacting with your Mac.

Many of these features can be extended and enhanced through plugins. For detailed information about specific plugins and how to install them, see the [Plugins](../plugins/index.md) section.
