# Touch Bar Support #

For Macs with a Touch Bar, the following will be available when Quicksilver is active:

  * Back/forward in history
  * Grab current selection
  * Clear the interface
  * Quick Look
  * Reveal Proxy
  * Show Task Viewer
  * Back/forward in collection
  * Explode collection
  * Remove last item from collection

The available buttons and their positions can be customized to your liking.

  1. Invoke Quicksilver (the interface must be visible)
  2. Go to the Quicksilver menu in the menu bar
  3. Choose “Customize Touch Bar…”

!!! note
    If you don’t normally run Quicksilver with the Dock icon visible, you’ll need to enable it temporarily to access the menu. (Preferences → General → Application → Show icon in dock)
    
    You can hide the Dock icon again once you’re happy with your customizations.
