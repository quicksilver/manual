# Preferences

Quicksilver has a configuration window that provides access to the Guide, Preferences, Triggers, Catalog and Plugins. These can be accessed several ways. The easiest is to activate Quicksilver (with <kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>Space</kbd>) and then use the standard shortcut <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>,</kbd> to bring up preferences. Other shortcuts are available to go directly to various sections of the preferences.

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>,</kbd> | Open Preferences |
| <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>;</kbd> | Open Catalog |
| <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>'</kbd> | Open Triggers |
| <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>"</kbd> | Open Plugins |

Other ways to access preferences:

  1. In the main command window, select one of the Internal Commands: Show Guide, Show Preferences, Show Trigger Preferences, QS Catalog Preferences, Show Plugin Preferences and use the Run action.

  2. Click the Dock icon and Quicksilver's menu appears, look under Quicksilver.

  3. If the menu bar icon is enabled, a menu is available by clicking on it

  4. Right-click the Quicksilver icon in the Dock.

The following sections describe these preferences. First, global preferences that affect how Quicksilver is activated and appears and then sections on Plugins, the Catalog, Actions, Handlers, and Notifications. Triggers are a large topic and are covered in their own entire section immediately after this one.

Configuring new Quicksilver features is usually done by installing the relevant plugin. Sometimes there are additional things to configure such as enabling new catalog sources, new actions (under Preferences, Actions) or relevant Handlers (under Preferences, Handers). Finally some plugins add their own preference panels listed in the lower left area of the Preferences window.
